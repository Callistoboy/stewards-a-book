Today, together, MkDocs and Material for MkDocs are among the most popular
options when it comes to choosing a static site generator and theme for your
technical documentation project. Material for MkDocs ensures that your
content is always perfectly presented to your audience, regardless of screen
resolution or device capabilities. It has evolved to a framework for technical

static site generators. However, we're far from the end, as 2022 is going to
bring some interesting new capabilities.
